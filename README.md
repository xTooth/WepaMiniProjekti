# WepaMiniProjekti


[Heroku app](https://anasocialnetwork.herokuapp.com/)

This is a simple "FaceBook" clone. A pre-existing user: 

username: asd

password: asd

(Beware it's not the prettiest site on the planet but the functionality should be decent.)

To run the project locally:

PREREQUISITE: maven and java8.

Run ```mvn spring-boot:run``` in the root of the project.

Some functions of the app:

- Friends - a user can add/ remove and block people.
- Posts - A user can make posts and read other peoples posts, these posts may include images.
- Likes and comments - a user can like posts, and comment on posts
- Profile - each user has a profile that contains some information about them aswell as all their posts.

Things that could be improved upon:

More of the front end could be handled via JavaScript for a more fluent experience.
